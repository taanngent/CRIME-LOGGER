# CRIME-LOGGER
Some crimes have been conducted by some sort of group or any individual in a locality. Police want to find the suspect.
According to study, every criminal left some evidence behind the scene which tells a lot about the suspect. 
Evidence is the information that we gather from the crime scene. If we organise that information in right manner, it will help the police to lead the case. 
Therefore, we are creating a software which take the information and analyse the pattern of criminal with our past records of criminal.
